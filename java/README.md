# VegaFusion-java
This directory contains the Java interface to VegaFusion. This is the pure-Java logic that relies on the native jni library generated by the `vegafusion-jni` Rust crate.

# Notes / Limitations
 - Vega JSON specifications are input and output as strings.
 - `VegaFusionRuntime.preTransformSpec` doesn't support inline datasets yet. 
 - `preTransformValues` isn't supported yet
 - `preTransformExtract` isn't supported yet
 - Custom SQL connections aren't supported yet (The default DataFusion connection is used)
